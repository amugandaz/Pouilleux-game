# Pouilleux-game

This Python project implements the game Pouilleux with two different approaches, one procedural and another object-oriented :

- pouilleuxGameProcedural.py (procedural approach): This approach provides a structured and extensible framework for the game, making it suitable for more complex scenarios or larger-scale implementations while maintaining clarity and focus on the game's core mechanics.

- pouilleuxGameObjectOriented.py (object-oriented approach): This other approach to implementing the Pouilleux (Old Maid) game builds upon the procedural style from a simpler implementation and transitions to a class-based object-oriented approach. This version emphasizes the modularity and scalability of the game's logic by dividing responsibilities into distinct classes and methods.
